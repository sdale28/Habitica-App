# Habitica

[Habitica] is a great tool for staying productive and working toward your goals. This is a simple Mac client for Habitica so that you can open Habitica in a separate window and __keep Chrome closed__. You still need an internet connection to use Habitica in this app, but Chrome can stay closed and Facebook/Twitter/Youtube/Instagram can be kept behind the "Gates of Distraction".

*Note that I do not claim Habitica as my own. This application is built off of [Electron], a free and open source tool created by GitHub. Specifically, this project was based largely off of the [Electron API Demos] application. My application simply displays Habitica's site (a free and open source project) as a separate application.*
